<h3><a name="preface"></a>Preface</h3>

<p> This utility is designed to
buffer data during real time processing like on the fly audio encoding
or tape backups. It is optimized for high
throughput, fast and reliable response and low CPU load. The data is
not copied
around in memory. See <a href="#examples">examples</a>
for more details.<br>

</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Record an audio stream and
encode it on the fly. To avoid any interrupt in the audio stream the
encoder process must run at reasonable high priority and must not stop
becaus of a high I/O load or something like that. Here <tt>buffer2</tt>
comes
into play. With a data buffer of a few minutes capacity this can be
relaxed significantly.<br>

  </li>

  <li>Make a backup of a
workstation with tar or something like that over the network to a DLT
drive or anothe media which requires a high sustained data rate.</li>

</ul>

1024<sup>2</sup>
or 1024<sup>3</sup>
bytes. It is strongly recommended to use a multiple of 1kiB as buffer
size. Otherwise the performance may degrade significantly. By default
the buffer size is 64kiB.<br>

must not exceed 64kiB. This is a limitation of OS/2. By default the
pipe buffer size is 8kiB.</td>

to give the size in kiB, MiB or GiB, i.e. 1024<sup>1</sup>,
1024<sup>2</sup>
or 1024<sup>3</sup>
bytes. By default the request size is automatically calculated. For
buffer sizes below 256kiB one quarter of the buffer size is used, for
buffers sizes of 256kiB or more one eighth of the buffer size is used.
It is recommended that the maximum request size is a factor of the
buffer size to avoid fragmentation. Furthermore the request size should
not be larger than half of the buffer size. Otherwise the buffer
becomes very ineffective because large parts of the buffer may be
blocked by either the input or the output side. </td>

      <tr>

        <td valign="top"><kbd>/h=<var>level</var></kbd></td>

        <td valign="top">High
water mark. Once the buffer gets empty the output side of the buffer
will stop working until the buffer is filled up to the high water mark.
        <kbd><var>level</var></kbd>
may be followed by <kbd>k</kbd>, <kbd>M</kbd>

to give the high water mark in kiB, MiB or GiB, i.e. 1024<sup>1</sup>,
1024<sup>2</sup>

bytes. If <kbd><var>level</var></kbd>
is followed by <kbd>%</kbd>
it counts relative to the buffer size in percent. The default value is
zero. That causes the output side to resume as soon as any data is
available.<br>

This parameter may be used to defragment streaming data in pipes or to
avoid unnecessary stops of tape drives or CD writers. In the latter
cases a value of <kbd>100%</kbd>
may be reasonable. This causes nothing to be written until the buffer
is full (or the end of the input stream is reached, of course).<br>

        <td valign="top">Low

choice to use the file system's cache here, because the FIFO is in fact
a kind of cache. Generally this will only increase the load on the CPU
to memory interface.<br>
